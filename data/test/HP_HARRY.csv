HARRY,Muggle?
HARRY,Okay.
HARRY,First year's students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand.
HARRY,One pair of dragon hide gloves.
HARRY,"Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?"
HARRY,You'd like a dragon?
HARRY,"All students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."
HARRY,Can we find all this in London?
HARRY,"Oh, nice to meet you."
HARRY,Goodbye.
HARRY,"But why am I famous, Hagrid?"
HARRY,"All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
HARRY,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?"
HARRY,I haven't any money.
HARRY,"Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
HARRY,"What's in there, Hagrid?"
HARRY,I still need... a wand.
HARRY,Hello?
HARRY,Hello?
HARRY,"Sorry, but what's curious?"
HARRY,And who owned that wand?
HARRY,"He killed my parents, didn't he?"
HARRY,The one who gave me this.
HARRY,"You know, Hagrid. "
HARRY,I know you do.
HARRY,Maybe if you wrote it down?
HARRY,Voldemort?
HARRY,Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
HARRY,What happened to V...?
HARRY,To You-Know-Who?
HARRY,Platform 9 3/4?
HARRY,"But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake."
HARRY,This says platform 9 3/4.
HARRY,"There's no such thing, is there?"
HARRY,Excuse me. Excuse me.
HARRY,"Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4?"
HARRY,Muggles?

HARRY,I've got Dumbledore!
HARRY,"Hey, he's gone!"
HARRY,Just a little bit.
HARRY,Yeah.
HARRY,"Hey, Hagrid."
HARRY,"I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks."
HARRY,"Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine."
HARRY,"Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!"
HARRY,"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
HARRY,What's he teach?
HARRY,I think she fancies you.
HARRY,We got lost.
HARRY,"I don't know, Sir."
HARRY,"I don't know, Sir."
HARRY,"Clearly, Hermione knows."
HARRY,Seems a pity not to ask her.
HARRY,What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
HARRY,Can I borrow this? Thanks.
HARRY,Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
HARRY,Listen.
HARRY,"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken."
HARRY,"The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day."""
HARRY,That's odd. 
HARRY,That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
HARRY,"Give it here, Malfoy."
HARRY,Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!
HARRY,Let's go this way.
HARRY,It's locked!
HARRY,What was that?
HARRY,I think she heard you.
HARRY,Where's Hermione?
HARRY,Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
HARRY,"Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her."
HARRY,Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
HARRY,Knight to E-5.
HARRY,There was no name. 
HARRY,"It just said, ""Use it well."""
HARRY,Famous fire eaters...
HARRY,15th Century Fiends...Flamel...
HARRY,Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
HARRY,Look in properly. Go on. 
HARRY,Stand there. There. 
HARRY,"You see them, don't you? "
HARRY,Thats my dad
HARRY,No.
HARRY,No.
HARRY,Malfoy.
HARRY,I found him!
HARRY,Go on!
HARRY,I knew the name sound familiar.
HARRY,I read it on the train that day.
HARRY, Shh!
HARRY,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. 
HARRY,He told me so the first time I met him.
HARRY,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
HARRY,Snoring
HARRY,I don't know. 
HARRY,Sounds like wings.
HARRY,"But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
HARRY,"All right there, Ron?"
HARRY,All right. Hermione?
HARRY,Good job.
HARRY,One minute. 
HARRY,"Thanks, Hagrid. "
HARRY,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
HARRY,I'm not going home. Not really.
HARRY,Now youve done it.
HARRY,But shes bored! 
HARRY,If I could only let out for an hour or two
HARRY,But I havent had any messages from any of my friends... not one all summer.
HARRY,"Ill be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I dont exist."
HARRY,Who are you?
HARRY,"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isnt a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
HARRY,Why dont you sit down?
HARRY,"Dobby, ssh! Im sorry! "
HARRY,"I didnt mean to offend you, or anything."
HARRY,You cant have met many decent wizards then.
HARRY,"Stop, Dobby!"
HARRY,"Dobby, shh!"
HARRY,"Dobby, please stop!"
HARRY,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. "
HARRY,Please be quiet! 
HARRY,Are you all right?
HARRY,Your family?
HARRY,What terrible things? 
HARRY,Whos plotting them?
HARRY,Ok I- understand. You cant- say.
HARRY,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
HARRY,Ron! Fred. George. 
HARRY,What are you all doing here?
HARRY,Ahh- ahh!
HARRY,Let go of me!
HARRY,Get off!
HARRY,Floo powder?
HARRY,Diagonally.
HARRY,"I'm fine, thank you. I was just going..."
HARRY, No. Please...
HARRY,Hagrid!
HARRY,"I was lost, I..."
HARRY,Hang on.
HARRY,What were you doing down there then?
HARRY,It's great to see you too.
HARRY,I definitely need to remember that one.
HARRY,Thank you. Bye.
HARRY,Voldemort killed my parents.
HARRY,He was nothing more than a murderer.
HARRY,Let's go.
HARRY,Sorry.
HARRY,Lost control of the trolley.
HARRY,Why can't we get through?
HARRY,The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
HARRY,We've missed it.
HARRY,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
HARRY,"Ron, I should tell you most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
HARRY,"Come on, then. Let's go lower."
HARRY,We need to find the train.
HARRY,All we need to do is catch up with the train.
HARRY,Do you hear that?
HARRY,Hold on.
HARRY,I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
HARRY,I think we found the train.
HARRY,Up! Up!
HARRY,"Up! Ron, mind that tree!"
HARRY,Be thankful it's not your neck.
HARRY,I don't know.
HARRY,"Come on, go! Fast!"
HARRY,"See you, Hedwig."
HARRY,So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4...
HARRY,we almost get killed by a tree...
HARRY,Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
HARRY,Professor Dumbledore.
HARRY,Professor McGonagall.
HARRY,You're doomed.
HARRY,"Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
HARRY,Stop. Hold still!
HARRY,Malfoy?
HARRY,"No, Colin, get out of the way."
HARRY,Let's take him to Hagrid's.
HARRY,He'll know what to do.
HARRY,Malfoy. He called Hermione...
HARRY,"Well, I don't know exactly what it means."
HARRY,What's a Mudblood?
HARRY,That's horrible.
HARRY,Not really.
HARRY,What?
HARRY,That voice.
HARRY,Didn't you hear it?
HARRY,Spooky.
HARRY,Did you hear it?
HARRY,That voice.
HARRY,I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
HARRY,And then again just...
HARRY,It's moving.
HARRY,I think it's going to kill.
HARRY,Strange.
HARRY,I've never seen spiders act like that.
HARRY,"Oh, no."
HARRY,It's Filch's cat.
HARRY,It's Mrs. Norris.
HARRY,No. No.
HARRY,"It's not true, sir. I swear."
HARRY,I never touched Mrs. Norris.
HARRY,When I said I wasn't hungry.
HARRY,We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
HARRY,Strange?
HARRY,Do you think I should have told them?
HARRY,"Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
HARRY,"If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... "
HARRY,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione."
HARRY,"I mean, look at his family."
HARRY,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
HARRY,How long will it take to make?
HARRY,A month?
HARRY,"But, Hermione,"
HARRY,if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
HARRY,"Wood, look out!"
HARRY,Thank you.
HARRY,No. I think my arm is broken.
HARRY,"No, Not you."
HARRY,Dobby?
HARRY,It was you. 
HARRY,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
HARRY,You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
HARRY,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
HARRY,"You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby, or I might strangle you."
HARRY,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
HARRY,"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
HARRY,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
HARRY,Stop it!
HARRY,"Stop it, Dobby!"
HARRY,Tell me Dobby when did this happen before?
HARRY,Who's doing it now?
HARRY,"No, Dobby. Tell me."
HARRY,Who is it?
HARRY,"Thank you, sir."
HARRY,You wish.
HARRY,Rictusempra!
HARRY,I'm a what?
HARRY,I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
HARRY,Once. But so what?
HARRY,I bet loads of people here can do it.
HARRY,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...
HARRY,You were there. You heard me.
HARRY,I spoke a different language?
HARRY,But I didn't realize...
HARRY,How can I speak a language without knowing I can?
HARRY,But I'm not.
HARRY,I can't be.
HARRY,I'll see you back in the common room.
HARRY,No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
HARRY,Professor I swear I didn't.
HARRY,Professor Dumbledore?
HARRY,I...I..I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.
HARRY,You're wrong.
HARRY,Professor.
HARRY,Your bird...There was nothing I could do.
HARRY,He just caught fire.
HARRY,"You don't think it was me, professor?"
HARRY,"No, sir. Nothing"
HARRY,Crabbe and Goyle.
HARRY,"Ron, maybe I should do it."
HARRY,Wingardium Leviosa.
HARRY,"Come on, let's get them."
HARRY,Ron.
HARRY,We still sound like ourselves.
HARRY,You need to sound more like Crabbe.
HARRY,Excellent.
HARRY,"Hermione, are you okay?"
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
HARRY,I'm...
HARRY,Ah- um.. Reading.
HARRY,You're wrong!
HARRY,Harry Potter?
HARRY,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
HARRY,It's his stomachache.
HARRY,Calm down.
HARRY,Hair!
HARRY,"Hermione, come out."
HARRY,We've got loads to tell you.
HARRY,Hermione?
HARRY,Are you okay?
HARRY,She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.
HARRY,What's this?
HARRY,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
HARRY,Why would I throw something at you?
HARRY,"But who threw it at you, anyway?"
HARRY,"""Tom Marvolo Riddle."""
HARRY,My name is Harry Potter.
HARRY,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
HARRY,Can you tell me?
HARRY,Excuse me. 
HARRY,Could you tell me what's going on here?
HARRY,Are you Tom Riddle?
HARRY,"Hello, can you hear me?"
HARRY,Dumbledore?
HARRY,Hagrid!
HARRY,HAAGRIIID!
HARRY,Wow!
HARRY,It was Hagrid. 
HARRY,Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
HARRY,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron."
HARRY,What would any of us have done?
HARRY,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
HARRY,And they found it.
HARRY,Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
HARRY,No.
HARRY,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron."
HARRY,I can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
HARRY,I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
HARRY,What's that for?
HARRY,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
HARRY,Did you hear about Hermione?
HARRY,"Look, we have to ask you something."
HARRY,Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
HARRY,Look.
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,"Come on, Fang."
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,You heard what Hagrid said.
HARRY,Follow the spiders.
HARRY,Shush!
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,Don't panic.
HARRY,We're friends of Hagrid's.
HARRY,And you?
HARRY,"You're Aragog, aren't you?"
HARRY,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks."
HARRY,They think it's Hagrid.
HARRY,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
HARRY,Then you're not the monster?
HARRY,"But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?"
HARRY,But have you seen it?
HARRY,What?
HARRY,"Well, thank you."
HARRY,We'll just go.
HARRY,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
HARRY,Let's go!
HARRY,Arania Exumai!
HARRY,Go!
HARRY,Arania Exumai!
HARRY,Don't mention it.
HARRY,Get us out of here.
HARRY,Now!
HARRY,Come on!
HARRY,"Come on, move faster!"
HARRY,Come on! Go!
HARRY,Get us in the air.
HARRY,Come on! Pull!
HARRY,We know one thing.
HARRY,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY,He was innocent.
HARRY,"Wish you were here, Hermione."
HARRY,We need you.
HARRY,Now more than ever.
HARRY,Ron...
HARRY,This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk."
HARRY,Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
HARRY,Spiders flee before it.
HARRY,"Ron, this is it."
HARRY,The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
HARRY,That's why I can hear it speak.
HARRY,It's a snake.
HARRY,Because no one did look it in the eye.
HARRY,"Not directly, at least."
HARRY,Colin saw it through his camera.
HARRY,Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
HARRY,Nick got the full blast of it.
HARRY,"But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again."
HARRY,And Hermione had the mirror.
HARRY,I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
HARRY,The water.
HARRY,There was water on the floor that night.
HARRY,She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
HARRY,Spiders flee before it.
HARRY,It all fits.
HARRY,Hermione's answered that too.
HARRY,Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
HARRY,She died in a bathroom?
HARRY,What if she never left?
HARRY,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber."
HARRY,At least we can tell him what we know.
HARRY,"Professor, we have some information for you."
HARRY,Are you going somewhere?
HARRY,You're running away?
HARRY,After all you did in your books?
HARRY,You wrote them.
HARRY,You're a fraud.
HARRY,You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
HARRY,Don't even think about it.
HARRY,To ask you how you died.
HARRY,"Who was it, Myrtle?"
HARRY,Just like that? How?
HARRY,This is it.
HARRY,"This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
HARRY,"Yes, there is."
HARRY,You first.
HARRY,All right. Let's go.
HARRY,"Thanks, Myrtle."
HARRY,"Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
HARRY,This way.
HARRY,It's a snake skin.
HARRY,"Ron! Ron, are you okay?"
HARRY,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
HARRY,I'll go on and find Ginny.
HARRY,"Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead."
HARRY,"Wake up, wake up."
HARRY,Please wake up.
HARRY,Tom. Tom Riddle.
HARRY,"What do you mean, she won't wake?"
HARRY,She's not...?
HARRY,Are you a ghost?
HARRY,She's cold as ice.
HARRY,"Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up."
HARRY,"You've got to help me, Tom."
HARRY,There's a basilisk.
HARRY,"Give me my wand, Tom."
HARRY,We've got to go. We've got to save her.
HARRY,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
HARRY,But why?
HARRY,And why did you want to meet me?
HARRY,Hagrid's my friend.
HARRY,"And you framed him, didn't you?"
HARRY,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
HARRY,"Well, you haven't finished it this time."
HARRY,"In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready."
HARRY,And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
HARRY,Why do you care how I escaped?
HARRY,Voldemort was after your time.
HARRY,You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
HARRY,You're Voldemort.
HARRY,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
HARRY,He'll never be gone. 
HARRY,Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
HARRY,Fawkes?
HARRY,Ginny?
HARRY,Ginny?
HARRY,Don't worry.
HARRY,"Ginny, you need to get yourself out."
HARRY,Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.
HARRY,"You were brilliant, Fawkes."
HARRY,I just wasn't quick enough.
HARRY,Of course.
HARRY,Phoenix tears have healing powers.
HARRY,Thanks.
HARRY,"It's all right, Ginny."
HARRY,It's over.
HARRY,It's just a memory.
HARRY,It's just...
HARRY,"You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain..."
HARRY,Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
HARRY,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
HARRY,So the Sorting Hat was right.
HARRY,I should be in Slytherin.
HARRY,Because I asked it to.
HARRY,Godric Gryffindor.
HARRY,Dobby.
HARRY,So this is your master.
HARRY,The family you serve is the Malfoys.
HARRY,Don't worry. I will be.
HARRY,Sir? I wonder if I could have that?
HARRY,Mr. Malfoy.
HARRY,Mr. Malfoy!
HARRY,I have something of yours.
HARRY,"I think you do, sir."
HARRY,I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day at Diagon Alley.
HARRY,Open it.
HARRY,Just promise me something.
HARRY,Never try to save my life again.
HARRY,We had loads of help from you.
HARRY,We couldn't have done it without you.
HARRY,"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
HARRY,Lumos Maxima...
HARRY,Lumos Maxima...
HARRY,Lumos Maxima...
HARRY,Lumos... MAXIMA!
HARRY,Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form.
HARRY,Nothing. School stuff
HARRY,I will if she does.
HARRY,Yes.
HARRY,Okay.
HARRY,"Oh, yeah."
HARRY,Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
HARRY,That's a lie.
HARRY,My dad wasn't a drunk.
HARRY,Shut up! Shut up!
HARRY,No. She deserved what she got.
HARRY,Keep away from me.
HARRY,Yeah? Try me.
HARRY,I don't care.
HARRY,Anywhere is better than here.
HARRY,I fell over.
HARRY,I didn't do it on purpose.
HARRY,Nothing.
HARRY,I didn't.
HARRY,he Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
HARRY,But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
HARRY,Who is that? That man.
HARRY,How did he escape?
HARRY,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
HARRY,Hedwig.
HARRY,"No, thank you. Minister?"
HARRY,I don't understand.
HARRY,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
HARRY,"The state of things, sir?"
HARRY,"Sirius Black, you mean?"
HARRY,But what's he got to do with me?
HARRY,Hedwig.
HARRY,Egypt. What's it like?
HARRY,Mrs. Weasley.
HARRY,Good to see you too.
HARRY,Yes.
HARRY,It's all upstairs.
HARRY,Everything.
HARRY,Thank you.
HARRY,Mr. Weasley.
HARRY,"Yeah, sure."
HARRY,Yeah. It should be great.
HARRY,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
HARRY,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
HARRY,Voldemort.
HARRY,Sorry.
HARRY,And kill me.
HARRY,Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
HARRY,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...I lost control.
HARRY,I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
HARRY,Do you think he's really asleep?
HARRY,I gotta tell you something.
HARRY,Yeah.
HARRY,"Thanks, Ron."
HARRY,I don't know.
HARRY,Maybe we've broken down.
HARRY,Thank you.
HARRY,What was that thing that came?
HARRY,What happened to me?
HARRY,And did either of you two you know pass out?
HARRY,But someone was screaming.
HARRY,A woman.
HARRY,How did he find out?
HARRY,Fortuna Major.
HARRY,Fortuna Major.
HARRY,Thank you.
HARRY,Still doing that after three years.
HARRY,She can't even sing.
HARRY,"Hey, man."
HARRY,"Shut up, Malfoy."
HARRY,What?
HARRY,"Hey, hey, hey!"
HARRY,"Brilliant, professor."
HARRY,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
HARRY,"I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
HARRY,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
HARRY,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
HARRY,I did think of Voldemort at first.
HARRY,But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
HARRY,Before I fainted I heard something.
HARRY,A woman screaming.
HARRY,I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
HARRY,Haunted building in Britain. I know.
HARRY,What's going on?
HARRY,"Excuse me, sir."
HARRY,Where's Professor Lupin?
HARRY,It's Quidditch tomorrow.
HARRY,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
HARRY,"Oh, brilliant."
HARRY,What happened?
HARRY,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
HARRY,No.
HARRY,"Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?"
HARRY,"I mean, more than everyone else?"
HARRY,"I'm scared, professor."
HARRY,I need to know how to fight them.
HARRY,You could teach me.
HARRY,You made the one on the train go away.
HARRY,But you made it go away.
HARRY,"Guys, let me go."
HARRY,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
HARRY,"Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
HARRY,What are you doing?!
HARRY,What's this rubbish?
HARRY,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
HARRY,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that
HARRY,No. Is that really...?
HARRY,So you mean this map shows...
HARRY,Everyone?
HARRY,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
HARRY,He was their friend and he betrayed them.
HARRY,He was their friend!
HARRY,I hope he finds me.
HARRY,"Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!"
HARRY,"When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
HARRY,I'm sure.
HARRY,Yes.
HARRY,Expecto Patronum.
HARRY,Shall we? Wand at the ready.
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,Expecto... Expecto...Expect...
HARRY,That's one nasty dementor.
HARRY,The first time I rode a broom.
HARRY,There's another.
HARRY,"It's not happy, exactly."
HARRY,"Well, it is."
HARRY,It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
HARRY,Just do it.
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,I think I've had enough for today.
HARRY,I was thinking of him. And Mum.
HARRY,Seeing their faces.
HARRY,They were talking to me.
HARRY,Just talking.
HARRY,That's the memory I chose.
HARRY,I don't even know if it's real.
HARRY,But it's the best I have.
HARRY,Ripped to pieces?
HARRY,What are you talking about?
HARRY,Tell those spiders.
HARRY,Sorry.
HARRY,Mischief managed. Nox.
HARRY,I was sleepwalking.
HARRY,My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
HARRY,"If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
HARRY,Spare bit of parchment.
HARRY,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
HARRY,And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.
HARRY,"No, sir."
HARRY,"Yes, sir."
HARRY,"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works."
HARRY,"Earlier, it showed someone in the castle."
HARRY,Someone I know to be dead.
HARRY,Peter Pettigrew.
HARRY,It's just what I saw.
HARRY,"Good night, professor."
HARRY,Hang on.
HARRY,We better take this back.
HARRY,Fine. See you later.
HARRY,Professor Trelawney...
HARRY,Sorry?
HARRY,No. Nothing.
HARRY,Why don't we just set him free?
HARRY,Hagrid!
HARRY,Hagrid.
HARRY,It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
HARRY,What?
HARRY,"Oh, no."
HARRY,Ron!
HARRY,Wait!
HARRY,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
HARRY,"Ron! Ron, wait!"
HARRY,Ron!
HARRY,Ron. Ron.
HARRY,Come on!
HARRY,Move!
HARRY,Don't worry.
HARRY,I have a hunch.
HARRY,I just hope I'm wrong.
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,Ron.
HARRY,The dog. Where is it?
HARRY,Then it'll be you!
HARRY,I know why.
HARRY,You betrayed my parents.
HARRY,You're the reason they're dead!
HARRY,"Who was it, then?"
HARRY,Expelliarmus!
HARRY,Tell me about Peter.
HARRY,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
HARRY,"The map was lying, then."
HARRY,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
HARRY,Show me.
HARRY,"Give it to him, Ron."
HARRY,No!
HARRY,I know what he is.
HARRY,But we'll take him to the castle.
HARRY,Get off!
HARRY,I said we'd take you to the castle.
HARRY,"After that, the dementors can have you."
HARRY,Okay.
HARRY,"No. Don't worry, okay?"
HARRY,It's fine. I'll stay.
HARRY,You okay?
HARRY,I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
HARRY,"Besides, dead, the truth dies with him."
HARRY,"Alive, you're free."
HARRY,I know.
HARRY,What? Come and live with you?
HARRY,Expelliarmus!
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,Sirius!
HARRY,Sirius!
HARRY,No. Sirius!
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,I saw my dad.
HARRY,He sent the dementors away.
HARRY,I saw him across the lake.
HARRY,They're gonna kill him?
HARRY,It's true sir. Sirius is innocent.
HARRY,What just happened?
HARRY,Where's Ron?
HARRY,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
HARRY,Hermione!
HARRY,"Hermione! Hermione, wait."
HARRY,"Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
HARRY,That's us.
HARRY,This is not normal.
HARRY,You mean we've gone back in time?
HARRY,Good punch.
HARRY,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
HARRY,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
HARRY,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
HARRY,That's Pettigrew.
HARRY,Hermione that's the he betrayed my parents.
HARRY,You don't expect me to sit here.
HARRY,Are you mad?
HARRY,That hurt.
HARRY,What?
HARRY,Get away. Get off.
HARRY,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. "
HARRY,Come with us now. Come on.
HARRY,Buckbeak. Okay?
HARRY,Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
HARRY,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?"
HARRY,This way.
HARRY,This way.
HARRY,"This way, now."
HARRY,Now what?
HARRY,How?
HARRY,And now we wait.
HARRY,Yeah.
HARRY,Hermione?
HARRY,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone."
HARRY,That someone made the dementors go away.
HARRY,It was my dad.
HARRY,It was my dad conjured the Patronus.
HARRY,Dead. I know.
HARRY,I'm just telling you what I saw.
HARRY,You see Sirius talking to me there?
HARRY,He's asking me to come live with him.
HARRY,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'."
HARRY,It'll just be me and him.
HARRY,We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
HARRY,He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
HARRY,Let's go.
HARRY,What are you doing?
HARRY,Thanks.
HARRY,Great. Now he's coming for us.
HARRY,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
HARRY,Sirius. Come on!
HARRY,Don't worry.
HARRY,My dad will come.
HARRY,He'll conjure the Patronus.
HARRY,Any minute now.
HARRY,Right there. You'll see.
HARRY,"Don't worry, he will."
HARRY,He will come.
HARRY,Sirius.
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,"You were right, Hermione."
HARRY,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!
HARRY,I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
HARRY,"I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it."
HARRY,Does that make sense?
HARRY,I want to go with you.
HARRY,But you're innocent.
HARRY,My mother's eyes.
HARRY,He's free. We did it.
HARRY,I don't know.
HARRY,"Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
HARRY,You've been sacked.
HARRY,Resigned? Why?
HARRY,But Dumbledore...
HARRY,None of it made any difference.
HARRY,Pettigrew escaped.
HARRY,What are you talking about?
HARRY,For me?
HARRY,But who sent it?
HARRY,Lumos.
HARRY,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
HARRY,Mischief managed.
HARRY,Nox.
