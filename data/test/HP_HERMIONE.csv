HERMIONE,Has anyone seen a toad?
HERMIONE,A boy named Neville's lost one
HERMIONE,"Oh, are you doing magic?"
HERMIONE,"Let's see, then."
HERMIONE,Are you sure that's a real spell?
HERMIONE,"Well, it's not very good, is it?"
HERMIONE,"Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me."
HERMIONE,For example:
HERMIONE,Oculus Reparo.
HERMIONE,"That's better, isn't it?"
HERMIONE,"Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!"
HERMIONE,I'm Hermione Granger.
HERMIONE,And you are...?
HERMIONE,Pleasure.
HERMIONE,You two better change into robes.
HERMIONE,I expect we'll be arriving soon.
HERMIONE,"You've got dirt on your nose, by the way."
HERMIONE,Did you know?
HERMIONE,Just there.
HERMIONE,"It's not real, the ceiling. "
HERMIONE,It's just bewitched to look like the night sky.
HERMIONE,I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
HERMIONE,"Oh, no. Okay, relax."
HERMIONE,Nearly headless?
HERMIONE,How can you be nearly headless?
HERMIONE,I've read about those.
HERMIONE,"When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something."
HERMIONE,Up. Up. Up!
HERMIONE,"Harry, no way!"
HERMIONE,You heard what Madam Hooch said.
HERMIONE,"Besides, you don't even know how to fly."
HERMIONE,What an idiot.
HERMIONE,You won't make a fool of yourself. 
HERMIONE,It's in your blood.
HERMIONE,We're not supposed to be here. 
HERMIONE,This is the 3rd floor. 
HERMIONE,It's forbidden.
HERMIONE,Alohomora
HERMIONE,Get in
HERMIONE,Wingardium Leviosa.
HERMIONE,Help! Help!
HERMIONE,Swish and flick!
HERMIONE,"Ron's right, Harry. "
HERMIONE,You're gonna need your strength today.
HERMIONE,That thing has a name?
HERMIONE,I don't know.
HERMIONE,"Look at you, playing with your cards."
HERMIONE,Pathetic!
HERMIONE,We've got final exams coming up soon.
HERMIONE,"Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
HERMIONE,Follow me!
HERMIONE,"Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?"
HERMIONE,Spells and enchantments.
HERMIONE,Is that bad?
HERMIONE,"You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
HERMIONE,Just relax!
HERMIONE,Do what I say. Trust me. 
HERMIONE,Are you okay?
HERMIONE,"Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! "
HERMIONE,That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!
HERMIONE,Lumus Solem!
HERMIONE,Me? Books and cleverness? 
HERMIONE,There are more important things. 
HERMIONE,"Friendship, and bravery. "
HERMIONE,"And Harry, just be careful."
HERMIONE,Never better.
HERMIONE,We're tied with Slytherin!
HERMIONE,"Come on, Harry."
HERMIONE,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
HERMIONE,Harry. Hagrid.
HERMIONE,It's so good to see you.
HERMIONE,What did you do to your glasses?
HERMIONE,Oculus Reparo.
HERMIONE,"Okay, bye."
HERMIONE,"Come on, everyone's been so worried."
HERMIONE,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
HERMIONE,"Mandrake, or Mandragora is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state."
HERMIONE,It's also quite dangerous. 
HERMIONE,The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
HERMIONE,Get off me!
HERMIONE,Immobulus!
HERMIONE,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
HERMIONE,They got in on pure talent.
HERMIONE,"You okay, Ron?"
HERMIONE,Say something.
HERMIONE,He called me a Mudblood.
HERMIONE,"It means ""dirty blood."
HERMIONE,Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
HERMIONE,Someone with non-magic parents.
HERMIONE,Someone like me.
HERMIONE,It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,Voice? What voice?
HERMIONE,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
HERMIONE,"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. 
Enemies of the Heir, beware."
HERMIONE,"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
HERMIONE,It's written in blood.
HERMIONE,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor."
HERMIONE,We'd just found him when he said...
HERMIONE,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
HERMIONE,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear..."
HERMIONE,and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.
HERMIONE,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
HERMIONE,Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
HERMIONE,Muggle-borns.
HERMIONE,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
HERMIONE,Yes. Couldn't you tell? 
HERMIONE,McGonagall's worried. 
HERMIONE,All the teachers are.
HERMIONE,The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. 
HERMIONE,"The question is, who is it?"
HERMIONE,If you're talking about Malfoy...
HERMIONE,I heard him.
HERMIONE,"But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
HERMIONE,Even they aren't that thick.
HERMIONE,But there might be another way.
HERMIONE,"Mind you, it would be difficult."
HERMIONE,Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
HERMIONE,and it'll be dangerous.
HERMIONE,Very dangerous.
HERMIONE,Here it is.
HERMIONE,The Polyjuice Potion.
HERMIONE,"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."
HERMIONE,Yes 
HERMIONE,Exactly.
HERMIONE,But it's tricky. 
HERMIONE,I've never seen a more complicated potion.
HERMIONE,A month.
HERMIONE,I know.
HERMIONE,But it's the only plan we've got.
HERMIONE,"No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky."
HERMIONE,You could hit Harry.
HERMIONE,Let's go.
HERMIONE,Finite Incantatem!
HERMIONE,Are you okay?
HERMIONE,"You will be able to, won't you?"
HERMIONE,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
HERMIONE,Maybe.
HERMIONE,We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
HERMIONE,No. No one ever comes in here.
HERMIONE,Moaning Myrtle.
HERMIONE,Moaning Myrtle.
HERMIONE,She's a little sensitive.
HERMIONE,Do you think he's all right?
HERMIONE,You can talk to snakes.
HERMIONE,"No, they can't."
HERMIONE,"It's not a very common gift, Harry."
HERMIONE,This is bad.
HERMIONE,"I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something."
HERMIONE,"Harry, listen to me."
HERMIONE,There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
HERMIONE,Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
HERMIONE,He could talk to snakes too.
HERMIONE,He lived a thousand years ago.
HERMIONE,"For all we know, you could be."
HERMIONE,Everything's set. 
HERMIONE,We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
HERMIONE,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
HERMIONE,I've got it all worked out.
HERMIONE,I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
HERMIONE,"Simple, but powerful."
HERMIONE,"Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms."
HERMIONE,I've already got mine.
HERMIONE,Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
HERMIONE,I got this off her robes.
HERMIONE,I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
HERMIONE,Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
HERMIONE,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
HERMIONE,Add the hairs.
HERMIONE,Cheers.
HERMIONE,Me too.
HERMIONE,I...I don't think I'm going.
HERMIONE,You go on without me.
HERMIONE,Just go. You're wasting time.
HERMIONE,Go away.
HERMIONE,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
HERMIONE,It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
HERMIONE,Look at my face.
HERMIONE,It can't be Hagrid.
HERMIONE,It just can't be.
HERMIONE,"Look, Hagrid's our friend. "
HERMIONE,Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
HERMIONE,It had to be a Gryffindor.
HERMIONE,Nobody else knows our password.
HERMIONE,Unless it wasn't a student.
HERMIONE,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas."
HERMIONE,It's good to be back.
HERMIONE,Congratulations.
HERMIONE,I can't believe you solved it.
HERMIONE,Thanks.
HERMIONE,"Oh, no."
HERMIONE,"It's a cat, Ronald."
HERMIONE,What do you expect?
HERMIONE,It's in his nature.
HERMIONE,That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
HERMIONE,"Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
HERMIONE,Harry.
HERMIONE,Egyptians used to worship cats.
HERMIONE,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
HERMIONE,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny."
HERMIONE,Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
HERMIONE,Come on. Everywhere else is full
HERMIONE,Professor R.J. Lupin.
HERMIONE,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
HERMIONE,Seems to be. Why?
HERMIONE,"But they'll catch Black, won't they?"
HERMIONE,"I mean, everyone's looking for him."
HERMIONE,Why are we stopping?
HERMIONE,We can't be there yet.
HERMIONE,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
HERMIONE,Harry.
HERMIONE,"Harry, are you all right?"
HERMIONE,"No one was screaming, Harry."
HERMIONE,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
HERMIONE,Just forget it.
HERMIONE,That's awful.
HERMIONE,What a load of rubbish.
HERMIONE,Me?
HERMIONE,I've been here all this time.
HERMIONE,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline."
HERMIONE,"Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
HERMIONE,A fair few.
HERMIONE,Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
HERMIONE,Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.
HERMIONE,I think they're funny.
HERMIONE,Just ignore him.
HERMIONE,Tah- tah- tah- dah! Isn't he beautiful?
HERMIONE,Say hello to Buckbeak.
HERMIONE,"That was wicked, Harry!"
HERMIONE,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.
HERMIONE,I hear Draco's father's furious.
HERMIONE,We haven't heard the end of this.
HERMIONE,Dufftown? That's not far from here.
HERMIONE,No one knows.
HERMIONE,Boggarts are shape-shifters.
HERMIONE,They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
HERMIONE,That's what makes them so...
HERMIONE,"It's not funny, Ron."
HERMIONE,"Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks."
HERMIONE,We're not meant to start that for weeks.
HERMIONE,"Please, sir."
HERMIONE,An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
HERMIONE,A werewolf has no choice.
HERMIONE,With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
HERMIONE,He'd kill his best friend.
HERMIONE,"Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
HERMIONE,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
HERMIONE,How are you feeling?
HERMIONE,"No one blames you, Harry."
HERMIONE,Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
HERMIONE,"After he saved you, he sent them off."
HERMIONE,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
HERMIONE,Do you want to move a bit closer?
HERMIONE,To the Shrieking Shack?
HERMIONE,Hope you don't mean yourself.
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
HERMIONE,Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
HERMIONE,Ron fancies her.
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,So rude.
HERMIONE,"Ron, look!"
HERMIONE,"Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me."
HERMIONE,"Harry, what happened?"
HERMIONE,Beautiful day.
HERMIONE,Ronald has lost his rat.
HERMIONE,Rubbish.
HERMIONE,"Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets!"
HERMIONE,Did not.
HERMIONE,Didn't.
HERMIONE,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
HERMIONE,And then?
HERMIONE,Do you mind me trying?
HERMIONE,"The Grim, possibly."
HERMIONE,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
HERMIONE,"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
HERMIONE,That felt good.
HERMIONE,We'll stay with you too.
HERMIONE,I think you owe someone an apology.
HERMIONE,I meant me!
HERMIONE,I thought I just saw...Never mind.
HERMIONE,Ron. Ron!
HERMIONE,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
HERMIONE,Ron!!
HERMIONE,Ron!
HERMIONE,Duck!
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,"Oh, I'm sorry."
HERMIONE,Where do you suppose this goes?
HERMIONE,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
HERMIONE,Ron. You're okay.
HERMIONE,"If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!"
HERMIONE,No! I trusted you!
HERMIONE,"And all this time, you've been his friend."
HERMIONE,He's a werewolf!
HERMIONE,That's why he's been missing classes.
HERMIONE,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
HERMIONE,You attacked a teacher!
HERMIONE,"You go, I'll stay."
HERMIONE,That looks really painful.
HERMIONE,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,Wait. Wait.
HERMIONE,Professor? Professor Lupin?
HERMIONE,Harry?
HERMIONE,What?
HERMIONE,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius."
HERMIONE,Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
HERMIONE,No. It's worse.
HERMIONE,Much worse.
HERMIONE,They're going to suck out his soul.
HERMIONE,"Headmaster, you've got to stop them."
HERMIONE,They've got the wrong man.
HERMIONE,"The point is, we know the truth."
HERMIONE,Please believe us.
HERMIONE,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
HERMIONE,07:30. Where were we at 7:30?
HERMIONE,Come on. And we can't be seen.
HERMIONE,"You! You foul, loathsome,evil little cockroach!"
HERMIONE,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry."
HERMIONE,McGonagall gave it to me first term.
HERMIONE,This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
HERMIONE,Yes.
HERMIONE,Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
HERMIONE,"Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
HERMIONE,Thanks.
HERMIONE,Malfoy's coming.
HERMIONE,That felt good.
HERMIONE,Of course.
HERMIONE,Remember what Dumbledore said?
HERMIONE,"If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared."
HERMIONE,Let's go.
HERMIONE,Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
HERMIONE,"Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
HERMIONE,"Harry, you can't."
HERMIONE,"Yes, and you must!"
HERMIONE,"Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now."
HERMIONE,"If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad."
HERMIONE,Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time Harry.
HERMIONE,We can't be seen.
HERMIONE,Fudge is coming.
HERMIONE,And we aren't leaving?
HERMIONE,Why aren't we leaving?
HERMIONE,Sorry.
HERMIONE,We're coming out the back door. Go!
HERMIONE,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
HERMIONE,I thought I just saw Never mind.
HERMIONE,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
HERMIONE,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
HERMIONE,"Come on. Come on, Buckbeak."
HERMIONE,Come and get the nice dead ferret.
HERMIONE,"Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky."
HERMIONE,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
HERMIONE,Buckbeak.
HERMIONE,Come on.
HERMIONE,We save Sirius.
HERMIONE,No idea.
HERMIONE,Look. It's Lupin.
HERMIONE,And Snape's coming.
HERMIONE,And now we wait.
HERMIONE,At least someone's enjoying himself.
HERMIONE,Yeah?
HERMIONE,With a Patronus.
HERMIONE,I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
HERMIONE,According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
HERMIONE,"Harry, but your dad's..."
HERMIONE,Here we come.
HERMIONE,That's great.
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,Saving your life.
HERMIONE,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
HERMIONE,That was so scary.
HERMIONE,This is horrible.
HERMIONE,"Harry, listen to me."
HERMIONE,No one's coming.
HERMIONE,You're dying both of you.
HERMIONE,Harry!
HERMIONE,No. But I don't like flying...!
HERMIONE,Bombarda!
HERMIONE,We have to go.
HERMIONE,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
HERMIONE,This came with it.
HERMIONE,"How fast is it, Harry?"
