HAGRID, I just got one more thing I gotta do.
HAGRID, Won't be long.
HAGRID,Harry! Harry!
HAGRID,Happy birthday.
HAGRID,"You all right, Harry?"
HAGRID,You seem very quiet.
HAGRID,"First, and understand this Harry because it's very important:"
HAGRID,Not all wizards are good.
HAGRID,Some of them go bad.
HAGRID,A few years ago there was a one wizard who went as bad as he can go.
HAGRID, His name was V...
HAGRID,His name was V...
HAGRID,"No, I can't spell it."
HAGRID,"All right, Voldemort."
HAGRID,"It was dark times, Harry. Dark times."
HAGRID,Voldemort started to gather some followers.
HAGRID,Brought them over to the Dark Side.
HAGRID,Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.
HAGRID,Your parents fought against him.
HAGRID,But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.
HAGRID,"Nobody, not one."
HAGRID,Except you.
HAGRID,"Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry."
HAGRID,"A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that."
HAGRID,"Well, some say he died."
HAGRID,"Codswallop, in my opinion."
HAGRID,"Nope, I reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on."
HAGRID,But one thing's absolutely certain. 
HAGRID,Something about you stumped him that night.
HAGRID,That's why you're famous.
HAGRID,That's why everybody knows your name.
HAGRID,You're the boy who lived.
HAGRID,What are you looking at?
HAGRID,"Blimey, is that the time?"
HAGRID,"Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you."
HAGRID,Dumbledore will be wanting his...
HAGRID,"Well, he'll be wanting to see me."
HAGRID,"Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes."
HAGRID,Here's your ticket. 
HAGRID,"Stick to it, Harry that's very important. "
HAGRID,Stick to your ticket.
HAGRID,"Right, then."
HAGRID,"First years, this way, please!"
HAGRID,"Come on, now, first years, don't be shy."
HAGRID,"Come on now, hurry up."
HAGRID,"Hello, Harry."
HAGRID,"Right, then. This way to the boats."
HAGRID,"Come on, now, follow me."
HAGRID,Looks like he's gonna be sick.
HAGRID,Nonsense. 
HAGRID,Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
HAGRID,"Now, you listen to me, all three of you. "
HAGRID,You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. 
HAGRID,It's dangerous.
HAGRID,What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
HAGRID,I shouldn't have said that. 
HAGRID,I should not have said that. 
HAGRID,I should not have said that. 
HAGRID,"Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. "
HAGRID,  I shouldn't have told you that.
HAGRID, Where you going?! Wait!
HAGRID,Yes!
HAGRID,"Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. "
HAGRID,Train's leaving. 
HAGRID,Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
HAGRID,"Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? "
HAGRID,This is for you.
HAGRID,Oh. Go on...on with you. 
HAGRID,"Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
HAGRID,"I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? Off you go."
HAGRID, Harry?
HAGRID,What do you think you're doing down here? Come on.
HAGRID,"You're a mess, Harry. "
HAGRID,Skulking around Knockturn Alley? 
HAGRID,Dodgy place.
HAGRID,Don't want no one to see you there.
HAGRID,People will think you're up to no good.
HAGRID,Me? I was... 
HAGRID,I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
HAGRID,They're ruining all the school cabbages.
HAGRID,"Hello, Hermione."
HAGRID,"You'll be all right now then, Harry?"
HAGRID,Right. I'll leave you to it.
HAGRID,This calls for a specialist's equipment.
HAGRID,"Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid."
HAGRID,Okay.
HAGRID,Better out than in.
HAGRID,"Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?"
HAGRID,He did not.
HAGRID,"See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood."
HAGRID,And it's codswallop to boot.
HAGRID,Dirty blood.
HAGRID,"Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less."
HAGRID,"More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do."
HAGRID,Come here.
HAGRID,"Don't you think on it, Hermione."
HAGRID,Don't you think on it for one minute.
HAGRID,Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.
HAGRID,"That's been tampered with, that has."
HAGRID,Broken? There's no bones left.
HAGRID,"Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
HAGRID,Wait! Listen!
HAGRID,"Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry."
HAGRID,I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.
HAGRID,Of course you don't.
HAGRID,"Ohh! Oww! Right. Well, I'll..."
HAGRID,"I'll just wait outside, then."
HAGRID,Let's get you out of there.
HAGRID,You can't. You don't understand.
HAGRID,It wasn't him.
HAGRID,Aragog never killed no one. Never.
HAGRID,No!
HAGRID,No!
HAGRID,Aragog! Aragog!
HAGRID,"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you?"
HAGRID,It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
HAGRID,"For the Mandrakes, you know."
HAGRID,"Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do."
HAGRID,"But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them. and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified."
HAGRID,"In the meantime, though, you three had best be looking after yourselves."
HAGRID,All right?
HAGRID,"Hello, Neville."
HAGRID,Who's there?
HAGRID,Hello? Hello?
HAGRID,Nothing. I was expecting... It doesn't matter. Come on in.
HAGRID,I just made a pot of tea.
HAGRID,I'm fine. I'm all right.
HAGRID,"Oh yeah. I heard about that, all right."
HAGRID,What you had to understand about that is...
HAGRID,"Quick, under the cloak."
HAGRID,Don't say a word.
HAGRID,"Be quiet, both of you."
HAGRID,"Professor Dumbledore, sir."
HAGRID,Of course. Come in. Come in.
HAGRID,But I never...
HAGRID,"You know I never, professor."
HAGRID,Take me? Take me where?
HAGRID,Not Azkaban prison.
HAGRID,What are you doing here?
HAGRID,Get out of my house!
HAGRID,You can't take Professor Dumbledore away.
HAGRID,Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.
HAGRID,"You mark my words, there'll be killings next!"
HAGRID,Well? If...
HAGRID,If anybody was looking for some stuff then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
HAGRID,Yep. That would lead them right.
HAGRID,That's all I have to say.
HAGRID,And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.
HAGRID,Sorry I'm late.
HAGRID,The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
HAGRID,Some ruddy bird called Errol.
HAGRID,"And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron and Hermione, of course I would still be you-know-where so I'd just like to say thanks."
HAGRID,"That's it. Come on, now. Come closer."
HAGRID,"Less talking, if you don't mind."
HAGRID,I got a real treat for you today.
HAGRID,A great lesson. So follow me.
HAGRID,"Right, you lot. Less chattering."
HAGRID,Form a group over there.
HAGRID,And open your books to page 49.
HAGRID,"Just stroke the spine, of course."
HAGRID,Goodness me.
HAGRID,"That, Ron, is a hippogriff."
HAGRID,First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
HAGRID,Very easily offended.
HAGRID,You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
HAGRID,It may be the last thing you ever do.
HAGRID,"Now, who'd like to come and say hello?"
HAGRID,"Well done, Harry. Well done."
HAGRID,Come on now.
HAGRID,Now you have to let him make the first move. 
HAGRID,It's only polite. So step up. Give him a nice bow.
HAGRID,Then you wait and see if he bows back.
HAGRID,"If he does, you can go and touch him."
HAGRID,"If not... Well, we'll get to that later."
HAGRID,Just make your bow.
HAGRID,Nice and low.
HAGRID,"Back off, Harry. Back off."
HAGRID,Keep still. Keep still.
HAGRID,"Well done, Harry. Well done."
HAGRID,"Here, you big brute, you."
HAGRID,Right. I think you can go and pat him now.
HAGRID,Go on. Don't be shy.
HAGRID,"Nice and slow, now."
HAGRID,Nice and slow. Slow.
HAGRID,"Not so fast, Harry."
HAGRID,"Slow down, Harry. That's it..."
HAGRID,Nice and slow.
HAGRID,Now let him come to you.
HAGRID,"Slowly, now, slowly, slowly..."
HAGRID,That's itYes!
HAGRID,"Well done! Well done, Harry,"
HAGRID,well done!
HAGRID,I think he may let you ride him now.
HAGRID,Come on.
HAGRID,"Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. "
HAGRID,"Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that."
HAGRID,"Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak."
HAGRID,"Well done, well done."
HAGRID,How am I doing me first day?
HAGRID,"Malfoy, no..."
HAGRID,No!
HAGRID,Buckbeak!
HAGRID,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
HAGRID,Whoa! Buckbeak!
HAGRID,"Away, you silly creature..."
HAGRID,Calm down. It's just a scratch!
HAGRID,I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
HAGRID,Class dismissed!
HAGRID,"Allow me, minister."
HAGRID,Sorry about that.
HAGRID,"Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there."
HAGRID,I got up and did my piece.
HAGRID,"Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers."
HAGRID,And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
HAGRID,"Well, you can imagine."
HAGRID,He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
HAGRID,"And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius."
HAGRID,"No, I'm not sacked."
HAGRID,Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
HAGRID,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
HAGRID,"They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble."
HAGRID,"He's coming down, Dumbledore."
HAGRID,Says he wants to be with me when they...When it happens.
HAGRID,"Great man, Dumbledore."
HAGRID,A great man.
HAGRID,You'll do no such thing!
HAGRID,Think I want you seeing something like that? No.
HAGRID,You just drink your tea and be off.
HAGRID,"Oh. Before you do, Ron..."
HAGRID,Keep a closer eye on your pet.
HAGRID,Blimey. What was that?
HAGRID,"Oh, crikey."
HAGRID,It's late. It's nearly dark.
HAGRID,You shouldn't be here.
HAGRID,"Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble."
HAGRID,"Particularly you, Harry."
HAGRID,With you in a moment!
HAGRID,Quick. Quick!
HAGRID,"Go on, go on!"
HAGRID,Professor Dumbledore.
HAGRID,Minister. Make your way through.
HAGRID,"Have a tea, if you like."
HAGRID,Gentlemen.
HAGRID,"Dear, dear..."
HAGRID,Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
HAGRID,Keep a closer eye on your pet.
HAGRID,Buckbeak.
HAGRID,Right.
HAGRID,"You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor."
