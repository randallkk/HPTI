RON,Copy off you.
RON,That's insulting!

RON,The car.
RON,"Aaa, Right."
RON,"Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty."
RON,Okay.

RON,"Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
RON,"We'll go and get our stuff, then."
RON,"You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
RON,Say it. I'm doomed.
RON,Bloody bird's a menace.
RON,What do we do now?
RON,I smell trouble.
RON,Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
RON,How did you get those?
RON,"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy."
RON,Eat slugs!
RON,It's disgusting.
RON,Hear what?
RON,Kill?
RON,I don't like spiders.
RON,What's that?
RON,Are you mad?
RON,Vera Verto!
RON,Three guesses who.
RON,Do you think it's true?
RON, Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
RON,Let's think. 
RON,Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
RON,Of course. You heard him.
RON,"You'll be next, Mudbloods."
RON,Crabbe and Goyle must know.
RON,Maybe we could trick them into telling.
RON,"You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
RON,Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
RON,I'll stop it.
RON,Of course.
RON,Don't you see?
RON,Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
RON,Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
RON,Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
RON,Don't you think we'll get caught?
RON,Why?
RON,Who?
RON,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
RON,Who cares?
RON,You're a Parselmouth?
RON,Why didn't you tell us?
RON,That's what you said to it.
RON,I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
RON,Snake language.
RON,Exactly.
RON,Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.
RON,How?
RON,"Whose hair are you ripping out, then?"
RON,Yeah. Right.
RON,How thick could you get?
RON,Essence of Crabbe.
RON,I think I'm gonna be sick.
RON,Harry?
RON,Bloody hell!
RON,Bloody hell.
RON,But where's Hermione?
RON,What are you doing d...?
RON,"I mean, what are you doing down here?"
RON,Stomachache.
RON,Scar!
RON,That was close.
RON,Look at your tail.
RON,Have you spoken to Hermione?
RON,Yuck!
RON,But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
RON,"I mean, it'll just go right through you."
RON,We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
RON,"He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch."
RON,That would be a cheerful visit.
RON,"Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
RON,"Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something."
RON,Hermione!
RON,But you heard McGonagall.
RON,We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
RON,That's Dad's boss.
RON,"Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic."
RON,Hagrid's right.
RON,"With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day."
RON,What?
RON,They're heading to the Dark Forest.
RON,"Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""?"
RON,"Harry, I don't like this."
RON,"Harry, I don't like this at all."
RON,Can we go back now?
RON,Harry.
RON,Harry!
RON,Can we panic now?
RON,Know any spells?
RON,Where's Hermione when you need her?
RON,Glad we're out of there.
RON,Thanks for that.
RON,The flying gear's jammed!
RON,I'm trying!
RON,Follow the spiders!
RON,Follow the spiders.
RON,"If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him."
RON,"I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?"
RON,What have we found out?
RON,What's that?
RON,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
RON,And Mrs. Norris?
RON,"I'm pretty sure she didn't havea camera or a mirror, Harry."
RON,How's a basilisk been getting around?
RON,"A dirty, great snake."
RON,Someone would have seen it.
RON,Pipes? It's using the plumbing.
RON,Moaning Myrtle.
RON,Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.
RON,Ginny.
RON,What about my sister?
RON,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
RON,You can't go now.
RON,Is there anything you can do?
RON,Say something. 
RON,Harry say something in Parseltongue!
RON,Better you than us.
RON,Go on.
RON,What's this?
RON,Bloody hell.
RON,Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more.
RON,"Heart of a lion, this one."
RON,Harry! Harry
RON,I'm fine.
RON,Ron Weasley.
RON,Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
RON,He hasn't got a clue who he is.
RON,No.
RON,What do I do now?
RON,Okay.
RON,"Thanks, sir."
RON,"Welcome back, Hermione."
RON,"I'm warning you, Hermione."
RON,"Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy."
RON,A cat? Is that what they told you?
RON,Looks like a pig with hair.
RON,Harry.
RON,"Brilliant. Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself."
RON,Along with the dung beetle.
RON,I haven't shown anyone.
RON,Brilliant.
RON,I still think it was brilliant.
RON,Who do you think that is?
RON,Do you know everything?
RON,How is it she knows everything?
RON,Oh.
RON,Let me get this straight.
RON,Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
RON,Sure.
RON,"Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
RON,What's going on?
RON,There's something moving out there.
RON,I think someone's coming aboard.
RON,Bloody hell! What's happening?
RON,"Well, you sort of went rigid."
RON,We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
RON,No.
RON,"I felt weird, though."
RON,Like I'd never be cheerful again.
RON,"Shove off, Malfoy."
RON,Green. That's a monkey.
RON,What is that?
RON,Do not give him one again.
RON,"Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
RON,I will.
RON,"Oh, don't try one of them."
RON,Look at him. His face.
RON,Where did you come from?
RON,Sure.
RON,Yeah.
RON,Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
RON,That's trials and suffering.
RON,And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
RON,"So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it."
RON,You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
RON,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
RON,Hang on. That's not possible.
RON,Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
RON,You have to be in two classes at once.
RON,You're supposed to stroke it.
RON,"Hagrid, exactly what is that?"
RON,Listen to the idiot.
RON,"He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
RON,Who?
RON,When did she get here?
RON,Riddikulus!
RON,"Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop."
RON,We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
RON,You heard it's the most...
RON,Probably Neville forgot the password again.
RON,"Oh, you're there."
RON,Serves her right.
RON,She was a terrible singer.
RON,Werewolves?
RON,When did she come in?
RON,Did you see her come in?
RON,"He's got a point, you know."
RON,"He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
RON,"Well, you fell off your broom."
RON,There's something else you should know too.
RON,"When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...Well..."
RON,Twice.
RON,"Actually, I'm fine here."
RON,"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
RON,"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?"
RON,"Bloody hell, Harry."
RON,That was not funny.
RON,Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
RON,Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
RON,That's not true!
RON,Thick heads.
RON,Merry Christmas.
RON,Gorgeous.
RON,Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
RON,I haven't lost anything!
RON,Your cat killed him!
RON,"Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about."
RON,And Scabbers is gone.
RON,Your cat killed him!
RON,Did.
RON,They're not sacking you!
RON,Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
RON,Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
RON,I don't wanna tap-dance!
RON,"Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them..."
RON,"She's gone mental, Hermione has."
RON,"I mean, not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see."
RON,I'm not going back.
RON,See you.
RON,It just got worse.
RON,"Hermione, no!"
RON,He's not worth it.
RON,"Not good, brilliant."
RON,Scabbers! You're alive!
RON,"Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know."
RON,Let's go!
RON,He bit me. Scabbers.
RON,"Scabbers, come back."
RON,"Scabbers, you bit me!"
RON,"Harry, Hermione, run!"
RON,It's the Grim!
RON,Ah! Harry!
RON,Harry!Help!
RON,It's a trap. He's the dog.
RON,He's an Animagus.
RON,Harry! What did you just do?
RON,Me?! He's mental!
RON,Scabbers has been in my family for...
RON,So what?
RON,What are you trying to do to him?
RON,Scabbers!
RON,Leave him alone! Get off him!
RON,What are you doing?
RON,A bit? A bit?
RON,You almost tore my leg off!
RON,You better go.
RON,I'm fine. Go.
RON,So painful.
RON,They might chop it.
RON,It's too late. It's ruined.
RON,It'll have to be chopped off.
RON,Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
RON,Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
RON,It's Scabbers who did it.
RON,"He's my rat, sir."
RON,He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
RON,He was my brother Percy's rat.
RON,But then they gave him an owl...
RON,What the bloody hell was that all about?
RON,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
RON,"Not good, brilliant."
RON,"Scabbers, you're alive!"
RON,Let's go.
RON,How did you get there?
RON,I was talking to you there.
RON,And now you're there.
RON,"Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle."
RON,Quiet.
RON,Let the man through.
RON,"I didn't mean to open it, Harry."
RON,It was badly wrapped.
RON,They made me do it.
RON,No one knows.
