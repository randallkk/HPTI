DUMBLEDORE,"I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall."
DUMBLEDORE,"I'm afraid so, professor."
DUMBLEDORE,The good and the bad.
DUMBLEDORE,Hagrid is bringing him.
DUMBLEDORE,"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
DUMBLEDORE,"No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
DUMBLEDORE,"Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?"
DUMBLEDORE,The only family he has.
DUMBLEDORE,Exactly.
DUMBLEDORE,He's far better off growing up away from all of that.
DUMBLEDORE,Until he's ready.
DUMBLEDORE,"There, there, Hagrid."
DUMBLEDORE,"It's not really goodbye, after all."
DUMBLEDORE,Good luck...Harry Potter.
DUMBLEDORE,I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce.
DUMBLEDORE,"The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students."
DUMBLEDORE,"Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death."
DUMBLEDORE,Thank you.
DUMBLEDORE,Let the feast begin.
DUMBLEDORE,SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!
DUMBLEDORE," Everyone will please, not panic. "
DUMBLEDORE,"Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. "
DUMBLEDORE,Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
DUMBLEDORE,"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. "
DUMBLEDORE,"Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
DUMBLEDORE,He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. 
DUMBLEDORE,"But yes, he will die."
DUMBLEDORE,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. "
DUMBLEDORE,That is one of my more brilliant ideas. 
DUMBLEDORE,And between you and me thats saying something.
DUMBLEDORE,"Love, Harry, love. "
DUMBLEDORE,Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. 
DUMBLEDORE,"I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. "
DUMBLEDORE,But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...
DUMBLEDORE,Mm. Alas. Earwax.
DUMBLEDORE,Another year gone. 
DUMBLEDORE,"And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. "
DUMBLEDORE,"In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. "
DUMBLEDORE,"Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. "
DUMBLEDORE,"In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points"
DUMBLEDORE,"And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House."
DUMBLEDORE,"Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. "
DUMBLEDORE,"And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. "
DUMBLEDORE,"And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. "
DUMBLEDORE,I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.
DUMBLEDORE,"Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. "
DUMBLEDORE,Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
DUMBLEDORE,They are not.
DUMBLEDORE,I am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself.
DUMBLEDORE,"However, as head of Gryffindor house it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
DUMBLEDORE,Argus!
DUMBLEDORE,"Argus, I..."
DUMBLEDORE,Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
DUMBLEDORE,Everyone except you three.
DUMBLEDORE,"She's not dead, Argus."
DUMBLEDORE,She has been Petrified.
DUMBLEDORE,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say."
DUMBLEDORE,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
DUMBLEDORE,"We will be able to cure her, Argus."
DUMBLEDORE,"As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake."
DUMBLEDORE,"When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris."
DUMBLEDORE,And in the meantime I strongly recommend caution to all.
DUMBLEDORE,There's been another attack.
DUMBLEDORE,It means that our students are in great danger.
DUMBLEDORE,The truth.
DUMBLEDORE,Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
DUMBLEDORE,"It is as we feared, Minerva"
DUMBLEDORE,The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
DUMBLEDORE,Harry?
DUMBLEDORE,And about time too.
DUMBLEDORE,He's been looking dreadful for days.
DUMBLEDORE,Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
DUMBLEDORE,"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry."
DUMBLEDORE,They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...
DUMBLEDORE,and then they are reborn from the ashes.
DUMBLEDORE,"Fascinating creatures, phoenixes."
DUMBLEDORE,They can carry immensely heavy loads.
DUMBLEDORE,Their tears have healing powers.
DUMBLEDORE,Hagriiid!! Relax.
DUMBLEDORE,I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
DUMBLEDORE,Yes.
DUMBLEDORE,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you."
DUMBLEDORE,But I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?
DUMBLEDORE,"Very well, then."
DUMBLEDORE,Off you go.
DUMBLEDORE,Riddle! Come.
DUMBLEDORE,"It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
DUMBLEDORE,"I'm afraid they are, Tom."
DUMBLEDORE,They are true.
DUMBLEDORE,"I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
DUMBLEDORE,Is there something you wish to tell me?
DUMBLEDORE,"Very well, then. Off you go."
DUMBLEDORE,"Good evening, Hagrid."
DUMBLEDORE,"I wonder, could we...?"
DUMBLEDORE,"I want it understood, Cornelius that Hagrid has my full confidence."
DUMBLEDORE,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
DUMBLEDORE,"Calm yourself, Hagrid."
DUMBLEDORE,"If the governors desire my removal I will, of course, step aside."
DUMBLEDORE,However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
DUMBLEDORE,"You both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules."
DUMBLEDORE,There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
DUMBLEDORE,"Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
DUMBLEDORE,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban."
DUMBLEDORE,I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
DUMBLEDORE,"Harry, First, I want to thank you, Harry."
DUMBLEDORE,You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
DUMBLEDORE,Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
DUMBLEDORE,And second I sense that something is troubling you.
DUMBLEDORE,"Am I right, Harry?"
DUMBLEDORE,I see.
DUMBLEDORE,"Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?"
DUMBLEDORE,Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
DUMBLEDORE,"If I'm not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
DUMBLEDORE,Not intentionally but yes.
DUMBLEDORE,It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
DUMBLEDORE,"Determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules."
DUMBLEDORE,"Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
DUMBLEDORE,"Exactly, Harry. Exactly."
DUMBLEDORE,Which makes you different from Voldemort.
DUMBLEDORE,It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
DUMBLEDORE,It is our choices.
DUMBLEDORE,If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.
DUMBLEDORE,Be careful.
DUMBLEDORE,It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
DUMBLEDORE,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
DUMBLEDORE,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
DUMBLEDORE,Beg your pardon?
DUMBLEDORE,Yes.
DUMBLEDORE,Voldemort.
DUMBLEDORE,Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
DUMBLEDORE,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it."
DUMBLEDORE,One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.
DUMBLEDORE,The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
DUMBLEDORE,"Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified."
DUMBLEDORE,"Also, in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled."
DUMBLEDORE,Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
DUMBLEDORE,"Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast."
DUMBLEDORE,"First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
DUMBLEDORE,"Good luck, professor."
DUMBLEDORE,Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
DUMBLEDORE,"Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid."
DUMBLEDORE,"Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic "
DUMBLEDORE,"Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured."
DUMBLEDORE,The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
DUMBLEDORE,Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
DUMBLEDORE,Dementors are vicious creatures.
DUMBLEDORE,They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
DUMBLEDORE,"Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you."
DUMBLEDORE,It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
DUMBLEDORE,"But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light."
DUMBLEDORE,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
DUMBLEDORE,Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
DUMBLEDORE,Keep moving!
DUMBLEDORE,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
DUMBLEDORE,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch."
DUMBLEDORE,"The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
DUMBLEDORE,Thank you.
DUMBLEDORE,Very good.
DUMBLEDORE,I didn't really expect him to linger.
DUMBLEDORE,"Quite remarkable, yes."
DUMBLEDORE,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
DUMBLEDORE,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
DUMBLEDORE,I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
DUMBLEDORE,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep."
DUMBLEDORE,"For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own."
DUMBLEDORE,Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
DUMBLEDORE,Aresto momentum!
DUMBLEDORE,"No, minister. Over this way."
DUMBLEDORE,That's ling you see over there...
DUMBLEDORE,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid."
DUMBLEDORE,Good evening.
DUMBLEDORE,I'd like a cup of tea.
DUMBLEDORE,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on."
DUMBLEDORE,All right. It'll be all right.
DUMBLEDORE,Scabbers?
DUMBLEDORE,"I do, Miss Granger."
DUMBLEDORE,But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
DUMBLEDORE,"A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen."
DUMBLEDORE,"Mysterious thing, time."
DUMBLEDORE,"Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous."
DUMBLEDORE,Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
DUMBLEDORE,"You know the laws, Miss Granger"
DUMBLEDORE,You must not be seen.
DUMBLEDORE,"And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime."
DUMBLEDORE,"If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss."
DUMBLEDORE,If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
DUMBLEDORE,"Three turns should do it, I think."
DUMBLEDORE,"Oh, and by the way."
DUMBLEDORE,"When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin."
DUMBLEDORE,Good luck.
DUMBLEDORE,"Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
DUMBLEDORE,It's such a very long name...
DUMBLEDORE,"Here we are, minister. Follow me."
DUMBLEDORE,"Now, look there."
DUMBLEDORE,Look beyond the rocks.
DUMBLEDORE,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
DUMBLEDORE,And all the strawberries.
DUMBLEDORE,Over there.
DUMBLEDORE,Over there.
DUMBLEDORE,All right.
DUMBLEDORE,How extraordinary.
DUMBLEDORE,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
DUMBLEDORE,"Afterall, How could you?"
DUMBLEDORE,You've been with us all the time.
DUMBLEDORE,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister."
DUMBLEDORE,"Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy."
DUMBLEDORE,"Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required."
DUMBLEDORE,Thank you.
DUMBLEDORE,Well?
DUMBLEDORE,Did what?
DUMBLEDORE,Good night.
